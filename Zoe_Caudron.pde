For context, I have always been fascinated by natural science; anything like petri dishes, moulds, fungi, ant colonies, slime moulds, all these things forming really incredible patterns got me really excited.

I am partaking to an experiment this year to study the Physarum type of slime moulds, and while looking things up, stumbled upon Sahe Jenson's amazing work.I've been meaning to reproduce similar work, and while the many hours
binge-watching the Nature of Code videos and various explanations online did not quite take me there (yet), I'm still happy with the progress I've made!
